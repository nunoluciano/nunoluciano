I'm an adult educator and multimedia producer who sees life pretty simply - we try to keep busy by doing things, some fail, some succeed, and almost everything we do has an impact on our environment and people.  

I am involved in developing tools that facilitate the expression of one's creativity, through art, design, music, learning, cooperation, etc... all things that give meaning to life.  

My contributions are usually very informal and without a pre-agreed agenda. This statement, simply put, means that "Serendipity" is an unintended chance discovery, a common occurrence throughout the history of product invention and scientific discovery: "Look for something, find something else, and realize that what you have found is more suitable for your needs than what you thought you were looking for."

## Web Development & Critical Thinking

Some make the distinction between usability and usefulness. Although it is impossible to quantify the usefulness of a system, 
attempts have been made to measure its attainment in reference to system specifications ‚Äî obviously been discontinued then. 
Anyway, all this is debatable. Experienced tasks can modify perceptions, so don't worry. 

**It's a perpetual learning workplace!**   

Start with a daily action plan ‚Äî this means, daily actions of asking, exploring, and applying.  
This approach can help you cope with stress and adversity. It's all about working on your self-development,  
improving your habits and resilience to thrive in a changing world. We all learn through trial and error.    

Have Fun ^_^/
